# WanLife

## Description
Life’s busy, right? Whether it’s scheduling your driver’s license test, getting some reading time in, or even planning that “last-minute” trip to Hawaii (because the Amazon jungle might be a bit much hahaha), WanLife has you covered!

- Schedule Like a Pro: Set events with specific time frames and get handy reminders before they kick off—no more “Oops, I forgot!” moments.
- Plan Together: Add your favorite people to your schedule, chat about plans, and coordinate events effortlessly. You know, like figuring out who's bringing snacks to the hike.
- Capture the Fun: After your event, you can add memories with emojis, photos, or videos because what’s life without showing off that adventure (or at least pretending it was one)?

WanLife provides an easy and intuitive way to stay organized while making space for memories that matter.
